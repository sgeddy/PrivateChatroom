# PrivateChatroom
This was an individual project in ECE 309, Object Oriented Programming, at NCSU. The project was to create both the front and back end of a private chatroom, written in Java. The chatroom stores users, passwords, and message history in a .ser file, and allows pictures and text. To start the chatroom, first run the PictureChatServer file from your command line on the desired host computer and record the server IP address and server port number. Then, open the PictureChatClient file from any desired client computer and input the server port and address, along with a previous or new username and password to connect.
